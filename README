This project uses Apache Mahout to form clusters in a data set based on K-means clustering algorithm. 
Although there is a direct command for creating clusters, the format in which clusters are outputted are not plain text. 

command.txt is the file that gives the command used.

src/src folder contains java code for converting to sequence file from text and vice versa and bunch of other required files to analyze the cluster data.
